My research interests aim at stochastic analysis and partial differential equations (PDEs), specifically, singular stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with jump noise. These equations originally come from different systems with random fluctuation in quantum physics and non- equilibrium statistical physics.
